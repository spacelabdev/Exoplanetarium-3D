## About Exoplanetarium 🪐

Spacelab is a project with the goal to explore NASA/CallTech data from the TESS, Kepler and K2 Missions using various degrees of Machine Learning and Deep Natural Networks in the pursuit of Earth-Like planets around nearby stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

Our short-term goal is to find objects on interest for professional Astronomers to explore, and to classify already-identified candidates that have not yet been classified as either exoplanets or false-positives by the astronomical community.
